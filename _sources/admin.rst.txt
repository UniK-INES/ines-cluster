Administration
************************

This part gives an overview about the adminstration of the cluster. It's main focus is on the server module since the nodes are using space on the server module's sd card to boot. Setting up a test system gives you the opportunity to recreate the system with a minimal amount of Raspberry Pi modules. It provides an insight on the internals of the productive system and can be used (almost) equivalent. Should you run into problems the Diagnosis section should be the first point to start. Troubleshooting lists some error scenarios that occur often while working with the system.

Important: it is physically not possible to access the client modules' hdmi output. Nor is it possible to access the kernel logs with the current configuration. The most reliable data about the state of the system is gathered via "side effects".

As an example: the GPIO LED of a specific module is off but the logs of the tftp server show the boot partition was sent correctly. Consequently the error happened when the operating system tried to boot so the first point to start would be the nfs server providing the root partiton / operating system.
